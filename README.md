"If I saved all the money I spent on beer, I'd spend it on beer." This repo is a very important application that lists beers from the PunkApi (https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2). This application has a client written in Vue3 with Apollo and Tailwind, and a server written with express and Apollo.
